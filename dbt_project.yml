# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

#  - "create table if not exists audit (model text, state text, time timestamp_ltz)"

#on-run-end:
#  - 'grant usage on schema analytics.dbt to role analyst'
#  - 'grant select on all tables in schema analytics.dbt to role analyst'
#  - 'grant select on all views in schema analytics.dbt to role analyst'
